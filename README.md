This repository is a copy from [Cern](http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/userdocuments.shtml).
When downloading the source, there was no explicit version control software being used.
To combat this, the source was downloaded, initialized into a Git repo, and then pushed up to this Github repo for safer storage.

You will notice that they call Geant "Geant4".
4 is simply a major version and inside of their source code, they use the minor and patch levels.
They also have a patch level for a patch level as well.
This does not follow semantic version control, but thanks to tags, you can now see exactly what changes from a patch's patch to a minor version bump.
